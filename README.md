## Quick Start

I recommend using the Ionic CLI to create new Ionic projects that are based on this project but use a ready-made starter template.

For example, to start a new Ionic project with the default tabs interface, make sure the ionic utility is installed:

```bash
npm install -g ionic
```

Then, you can start a new ionic project by running:

```bash
ionic start **projectName** tabs
```
More info on this can be found on the Ionic Getting Started page and the Ionic CLI repo.

Finally, run `ionic serve` in a terminal from the project root.
